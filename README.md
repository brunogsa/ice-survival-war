# What's this Project?

I long time ago I developed a Warcraft 3 Mod called [http://www.epicwar.com/maps/221823/](Ice Survival War) in Portuguese.
Now, I want to develop it as a Web Game using [https://phaser.io/](Phaser.js).

I want it to be Free and Open Source.

# What's the Game Idea?

There're 2 teams of Survivors.

Each Team spawns on a Ice Island and must cooperate to Survive.
The game ends when an entire team dies, so the challenge is to see which team will last longer.

- They must eat, drink, keep warm
- Survive the Environment and Creatures of the Island
- It's impossible to directly reach the Enemy Island
- However, It's possible to Summon Epic Monster on the Enemy Land
- Each player can craft items, build bases and fight the monster while helping each other
