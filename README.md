# What's this Project?

I long time ago I developed a Warcraft 3 Mod called [Ice Survival War](http://www.epicwar.com/maps/221823). <br>
Now, I want to develop it as a Web Game using [Love 2D](https://love2d.org/).

I want it to be Free and Open Source.

# What's the Game Idea?

There're 2 teams of Survivors.

Each Team spawns on a Ice Island and must cooperate to Survive. <br>
The game ends when an entire team dies, so the challenge is to see which team will last longer.

- Eat, keep warm, threat diseases, survive the environment and creatures of the island
- It's impossible to directly reach the enemy island, but curses and monsters can be summoned there
- Players can craft items, build bases and share resources
- The combat has a random factor, but is mostly defined by the players skill and strategy
